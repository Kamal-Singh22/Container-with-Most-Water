# Container-with-Most-Water
Given an array height where each element represents the height of a vertical line on a coordinate plane, find two lines such that they, along with the x-axis, form a container that holds the most water. Return the maximum amount of water the container can store.

Example:
Copy code
height = [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]

Output:
49
Explanation:
The lines at indices 1 and 8 (heights 8 and 7) form a container with the largest area:

Area = min(8, 7) * (8 - 1) = 7 * 7 = 49
